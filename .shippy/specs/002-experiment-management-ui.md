# SPECS: Basic Experiment Management UI

### Feature Description
Develop a user interface that allows growth practitioners to easily view, add, and manage their experiments. This UI will serve as the central hub for experiment tracking, replacing the need for external spreadsheets.

### User Stories
- **As a growth practitioner,** I want to see a list of all my experiments so that I can quickly get an overview of my ongoing and past work.
- **As a growth practitioner,** I want to be able to add a new experiment with its hypothesis, status, and key details so that I can centralize my experiment tracking.
- **As a growth practitioner,** I want to be able to view the details of a specific experiment so that I can understand its context and progress.
- **As a growth practitioner,** I want to be able to update the status and details of an existing experiment so that my tracking remains current.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The UI must display a list of experiments, showing at least their name, current status, and a brief description.
- There must be a clear and intuitive way to add a new experiment, including fields for name, hypothesis, status, and any other relevant metadata.
- Clicking on an experiment in the list should navigate to a detailed view of that experiment.
- The detailed view should allow for editing of experiment fields.
- All changes made through the UI must be persisted.

### âœ… Technical Plan of Action
- [x] **Task 1: Define UI Components:** Identify and outline the necessary React components (e.g., ExperimentList, ExperimentForm, ExperimentDetail).
- [x] **Task 2: Data Flow & State Management:** Determine how experiment data will flow through the application and how state will be managed (e.g., React Context, Redux, or simple useState/useReducer).
- [x] **Task 3: API Integration Strategy:** Plan how the UI will interact with the backend API for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting experiment data.
- [x] **Task 4: Implement Experiment List View:** Develop the component to display a list of experiments.
- [x] **Task 5: Implement Add Experiment Form:** Create the form component for adding new experiments.
- [x] **Task 6: Implement Experiment Detail/Edit View:** Build the component to show and allow editing of individual experiment details.
- [x] **Task 7: Routing:** Set up client-side routing for navigation between list, add, and detail views.
- [x] **Task 8: Basic Styling:** Apply basic styling to make the UI presentable and user-friendly.
